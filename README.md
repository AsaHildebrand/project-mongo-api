# Mongo API Project

In this project we were supposed to seed and fetch data from a Mongo database by using Mongoose model.

## The problem

This week I didn't have so many error messages as I had last week so it felt a bit easier to work with this API project. I watched the lectures and tried to implement different endpoints and play around with it to learn more. It was a bit difficult to deploy it to Heruko and Mongo but it turned out well after help from my team and discussions on Slack.
